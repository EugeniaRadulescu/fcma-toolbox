#
# Alternative methods for leaving out data:
# 1 you can always just arrange input datasets such
#   that you leave out one entire file from datadir
#   and leave this at -1
# 2 to leave out a block across all subjects,
#   create a blockfile with that block removed
#   (if the block left out should differ by subject,
#    use "blockdir:" rather than "blockfile:"
#    and create one blockfile per subject)

# - during voxel selection (is_test_mode:0, task_type 0-3)

#   is used for cross-validating top voxels in masks,
#   as in voxel selection, with FOLDS being derived via:
#      num_folds = num_trials / num_items_held_for_test 
#  for test cross-validation, set to 1 to get results
#  leaving out each block once, training on others
num_items_held_for_test:1

# FOLDS
# a parameter of the LibSVM classifier 
# applies only to tasks 0-3, is_test_mode:0
# Chops up the trials into bins/folds and leaves out
# trials from one of them each iteration during
# cross-validation. So setting to number of
# datafiles/subjects would score voxels based on
# leave-one-subject-out performance.
