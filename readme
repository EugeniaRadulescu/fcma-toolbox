1.0
the very beginning version using command line and ad-hoc input.

1.1
the input data and mask are in nifti format, the selectors and regressors are in a text file.
the RT regression part is removed
the flexibility of dealing with different data types is still needed.
the location.bin is not supposed to be there any more, since we have nifti files.

1.2
a huge progress and a lot of changes
add four tasks to use masks to do correlation and activation tasks.
incorporate libsvm code in the toolbox, no more -lsvm.
rewrite part of the svm code, use blas dot product instead of its own, and compute the length of a vector in libsvm before hand, by assuming that all vectors are with the same length. this accelerates the code by about 25%.
rewrite the voxel selection cross validation part, now if using linear svm, the code will use precomputed kernel instead of computing the kernel every fold. this accelerates the code quite a lot, say, from 10 hours to 20 minutes. but if using other kernel, currently the redundant computing is still needed.
add -Wextra -Werror to Makefile to eliminate a lot warnings, most of which are unused variables, unnecessarily passed from the function's input arguments.
add MPI_Barrier to make sure all nodes finish reading and progress together.
put all mask files in a sub directory.
nifti files are in two categories: 1) data, must be in short; 2) mask, can be in short or int.

1.2.1
redesigned the shared memory parallelization
fixed some minor bugs
allowed mask file data type to be float

1.2.2
allowed data file data type to be float
add a new input argument -e to specify the block file directory
