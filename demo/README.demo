The demo cannot run on github obviously, so this is just a placeholder with files that can be
kept on github for version control. The demo link in the index.html files in each subdir point
to a cluster with these demo pages actually running.

The uploads link is missing from the gh-pages repository because it only exists on the actual
demo server.
